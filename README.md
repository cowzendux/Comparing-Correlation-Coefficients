#Comparing-Correlation-Coefficients

Excel spreadsheet to perform a statistical test comparing correlations

The spreadsheet can compare three different types of correlations.
* Correlations measured on independent groups of subjects
* Independent correlations measured on the same group of subjects (i.e., testing r_{jk} = r_{hm})
* Dependent correlations measured on the same group of subjects (i.e., testing r_{jk} = r_{jh})

This and other Excel spreadsheets can be found at http://stat-help.com/spreadsheets.html
